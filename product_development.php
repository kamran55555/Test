The projects and custom syntheis can be done using the enriched isotopes (stable isotopes and radioisotopes) availalbe at our website www.buyisotope.com .<br>You are welcome to go to <a href="request_quote_stable_isotope.php"style="color:#29c7e8">"Request a Quote"</a>webpage and write your specifications for Product Development OR Custom Synthesis.<br><br>For more information,you are welcome to check lists of enriched isotopes and find out which chemical forms are available for each enriched isotope (stable isotopes and radioisotopes). If chemical form are not available then please specify on the <a href="request_quote_stable_isotope.php"style="color:#29c7e8">"Request a Quote"</a>webpage what would you like to produce/develop in details.
